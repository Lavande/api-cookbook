**TruthTracer** is a comprehensive misinformation detection platform that leverages Perplexity's Sonar API to provide multi-layered claim analysis. The platform combines fact-checking, trust chain tracing, and Socratic reasoning to deliver accurate, evidence-based verification results with confidence scores and detailed sourcing.

## Features

* **Multi-method Analysis** combining fact-checking, trust chain analysis, and Socratic reasoning
* **AI-Powered Verification** using Perplexity's Sonar, Sonar Deep Research, and Sonar Reasoning models
* **Real-time Processing** with parallel execution of multiple analysis methods
* **Evidence-based Results** providing sources, confidence scores, and detailed reasoning
* **Clean Architecture** with NestJS backend and React frontend
* **Production-Ready** with Docker deployment, comprehensive testing, and API documentation
* **Configurable Confidence Scoring** with customizable weights and thresholds

## Prerequisites

* Node.js 18+ and npm
* Perplexity API key (Sonar models access)
* Docker (optional for deployment)
* Git for repository cloning

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the backend repository
git clone https://github.com/anthony-okoye/truth-tracer-backend.git
cd truth-tracer-backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Clone the frontend repository
git clone https://github.com/anthony-okoye/truth-tracer-front.git
cd truth-tracer-front

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install
```

## Configuration

Create `.env` file in the backend directory:
```ini
# Required
SONAR_API_KEY=your_perplexity_api_key
SONAR_API_URL=https://api.perplexity.ai

# Optional configuration
SONAR_TIMEOUT=30000
SONAR_MAX_RETRIES=3
CONFIDENCE_WEIGHT_FACT_CHECK=0.35
CONFIDENCE_WEIGHT_TRUST_CHAIN=0.25
CONFIDENCE_WEIGHT_SOCRATIC=0.20
```

## Usage

1. **Start Backend**:
```bash
   cd truth-tracer-backend
   npm run start:dev
   ```

2. **Start Frontend**:
```bash
   cd truth-tracer-front
   npm start
   ```

3. **Access Application**: Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

4. **Analyze Claims**:
   - Enter a claim in the text area
   - Click "Analyze Claim" to run fact-checking, trust chain analysis, and Socratic reasoning
   - View results with confidence scores, sources, and detailed explanations

## Code Explanation

* **Backend**: NestJS application with clean architecture following TypeScript best practices
* **AI Integration**: Perplexity Sonar API with three specialized models - Sonar for fact-checking, Sonar Deep Research for trust chain analysis, and Sonar Reasoning for logical evaluation
* **Parallel Processing**: Simultaneous execution of all three analysis methods for efficient claim verification
* **Response Sanitization**: Custom JSON parsing and validation to handle various API response formats
* **Confidence Scoring**: Weighted scoring system combining results from all three analysis methods
* **Frontend**: React application with intuitive claim submission interface and detailed results visualization
* **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite including unit tests, end-to-end tests, and claim analysis testing

## How the Sonar API is Used

TruthTracer leverages Perplexity's Sonar API through three distinct analysis approaches:

```typescript
// Parallel execution of multiple Sonar models
const [factCheckResult, trustChainResult, socraticResult] = await Promise.all([
  sonarClient.chat.completions.create({
    model: "sonar",
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: factCheckPrompt }],
    max_tokens: 500
  }),
  sonarClient.chat.completions.create({
    model: "sonar-deep-research", 
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: trustChainPrompt }],
    max_tokens: 2500
  }),
  sonarClient.chat.completions.create({
    model: "sonar-reasoning",
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: socraticPrompt }],
    max_tokens: 4000
  })
]);
```
